# Visual-Analytics-Project

## General Information

This page dedicated to my group lab project of Visual Analytics at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

Our Project is about the insights we have discovered by using the Crime Data of LA City alone with other supporting data such as population and Income. 

You can find all the information including the code, visualisation, and presensation in the above folder.

Although there is a video recording, my on-site presentation was the one got voted as the best in class.

For a detailed project info  [Visual Analytics Moodel page](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=25624).
